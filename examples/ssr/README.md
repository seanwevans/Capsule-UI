# SSR Framework Examples

This directory contains reference integrations for server-side rendering with React, Vue and Svelte.
Each example renders a simple message on the server and hydrates on the client.

## Running an Example

Change into one of the framework folders and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to see the hydrated output.
